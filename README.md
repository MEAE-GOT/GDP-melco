# GDP-melco
The W3C Websocket implementation. The W3CClient is a HMTL client developed using Netbeans 8.1. The server is implemented in Qt 5.6 and tested on GDP-11 (Genivi Linux) on RPI3.

Note: To get qtwebsockets on the GDP-11 image use IMAGE_INSTALL_append in local.conf. See Yocto and Genivi for further info.
