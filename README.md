Testing W3C websocket server implementation.
Run **W3CTestClient** using webserver (Netbeans uses Chrome Extension).
Make sure to trust the self-signed cerificate. One trick is to start the serverand just enter https://server-ip-adress:8080 and then add the certificate to the browser.
 
=======
The W3C Websocket implementation. The W3CClient is a HMTL client developed using Netbeans 8.1. The server is implemented in Qt 5.6 and tested on GDP-11 (Genivi Linux) on RPI3.

Note: To get qtwebsockets on the GDP-11 image use IMAGE_INSTALL_append in local.conf. See Yocto and Genivi for further info.
