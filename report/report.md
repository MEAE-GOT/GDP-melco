# Abstract

The ability to access vehicle data signals with a standardized API opens up for innovation and feature growth outside the vehicle maker. It is also facilitating application development within the car - when there is a standard way of accessing signals applications can target multiple vehicles across OEM brands. 

  The W3C Automotive Working Group is currently developing specifications allowing developers to "write applications running in a web browser or an embedded web runtime on a carâ€™s infotainment system to access signals from vehicle sensors and to carry out actions via the vehicles actuators" [[1]](https://www.w3.org/blog/auto/2017/01/04/vehicle-data-interfaces/). The applications can also be developed complete apart from the web runtime as any application framework that supports web sockets will be enough. 
  
  This is a reference implementation of the W3C Vehicle Information Service specification [[2]](https://github.com/w3c/automotive/blob/gh-pages/vehicle_data/vehicle_information_service.html). The implementation is done on the GDP-11 [[3]](https://at.projects.genivi.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=14090346) platform targeting the RPI3 as its primary SOC. It is an open source project where the server is implemented with the Qt framework and added to the yocto based GDP-11 software platform.
  
# Architecture and Design

When selecting the Qt platform as the basis for the server implementation we argued that the Qt framework since v 5.4 inlcudes a web socket api, and since the Qt platform is currently one of the prefered application frameworks on Linux based infotainment platforms. Furthermore, Qt allows for rapid testing and development outside the actual target platform - it is a cross-platform development tool.

The basic server design is to spawn an independent thread through a thread pool mechanism for each request. The following requests are defined in the specification: GET,SET,GETVSS,SUBSCRIBE, USUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBEALL, AUTHORIZE. The thread deisgn will allow a request to run independently of any other client requests. Communication between threads is handled using the Qt signal and slot scheme[4* link to qt page]: for example when we have an unsubscribe request that needs to inform the corresponding subscription that it should stop sending data back to the client and terminate the subscription thread.


# Usability According to Spec

 We are able to use with a limited amount of vehicle signals using openDS car simulation and ODB signals that specification is impementable. We
