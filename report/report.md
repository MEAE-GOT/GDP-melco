# Abstract

The ability to access vehicle data signals with a standardized API opens up for innovation and feature growth outside the vehicle. It is also facilitating application development within the car as well - there is a standard way of accessing signals and adding OEM specific signals. The W3C Automotive Working Group is currently developing specifications "write applications running in a web browser or an embedded web runtime on a carâ€™s infotainment system to access signals from vehicle sensors and to carry out actions via the vehicles actuators" [a link](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.m)

This is a reference implementation of the W3C VIS specification: https://github.com/w3c/automotive/blob/gh-pages/vehicle_data/vehicle_information_service.html.
