      The server implementation is based on a simple idea that client every request is handled by a separate thread. Threads are reused through thread pool mechanism to reduce system memory and performance strains. The server implementation is able to handle multiple requests …

       <p>
       The server deployment is not bound to the infotainment system, i.e the actual IHU. The server can be deployed anywhere on any ECU inside the vehicle, but not only that the server could also be deployed outside the vehicle. The benefits of using internet based protocols is that the deployment of the signal server is boundless. It is a piece of software for the internet-of-things-everywhere. The use cases and features that this opens up for are endless…might move this to the abstract
